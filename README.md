# python-testing
a repo full of my test stuff for python 3
dont expect anything serious from this, im not trying to make anything yet
this is just a collection of scripts that i "made"
this is just to store my scripts so i can work at other places
its also cool to see my improvement from being clueless to being somewhat knowledgeable
